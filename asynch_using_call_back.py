#In this example, the download_file() function downloads a file from the given URL
#  using the requests module and passes the downloaded data to the callback function save_file(),
#  which saves the data to a file.

#The download_file() function takes two arguments:
#  url and callback. The url argument is the URL of the file to be downloaded, and 
# the callback argument is a function that will be called with the downloaded data
#  when the download is complete.

#The save_file() function takes one argument: data,
#  which is the downloaded data. It opens a file named file.txt
